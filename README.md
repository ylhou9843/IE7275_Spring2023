## Final Project: Online News Popularity Analysis

Background:
The expansion of social media has had a significant impact on various industries, especially the news media industry, providing both opportunities and challenges for news organizations and individuals. This has led to a shift in the way that news is produced and consumed. Therefore, it has increased the competition for attention, making it more challenging for news organizations and individuals to stand out.

In light of these, in this project, we propose to:
* Explore the relationship between news popularity and news characteristics
* Use features of articles to predict online news popularity before publication
